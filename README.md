Diploma Main Project - Shopfresh - Grocery shopping website
An online Grocery Store permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or
services from a store that serves online customers. The online Store system presents an online
display of all items they want to sell. This web application helps customers to choose their
daily needs and add products to their shopping carts. The customers can then pay for an item
which was already placed in the cart. They should provide their delivery address and contact
details for home delivery purposes. The items available in the online shop can be viewed
separately based on their category. Specific items can also be searched from a given list of
items can be searched to avoid inconvenience.

For designing an online grocery store, we create a website using PHP with MySQL.
This application can add grocery items by their name, quantity, status (available, not
available), and date. We can view, delete and update those items. There will be a category
filtering feature where we can view the grocery items according to the dates or categories and
also search for available items.
